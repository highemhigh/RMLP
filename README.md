## Dataset
Remember to cite if used any of the datasets.

- [Slavica Savic, "Multifocus Image Fusion Based on Empirical Mode Decomposition", Twentieth International Electrotechnical and Computer Science Conference, ERK 2011](http://dsp.etfbl.net/mif/):
Most of the image pairs are not registered. No groundtruth. Usable but not ideal.
- [Lytro Multi-focus Image Dataset](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291522937_Lytro_Multi-focus_Image_Dataset):
All image pairs are registered. No groundtruth.
- [A classification and fuzzy-based approach for digital multi-focus image fusion August 2011 Jamal Saeedi Â· Karim Faez](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273000238_multi-focus_image_dataset):
Some of the image pairs are not registered. Some of the image pairs have groundtruth.
