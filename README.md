## Checklist
- [ ] Photo data
- [ ] Synthetic data
- [ ] Public dataset to compare with other approaches
- [ ] Algorithm implementation
- [ ] Video demo


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for evaluation.

### Prerequisites
You should have a [functional `conda` environment](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

### Building and Running
Assuming you are in the repository root directory, create an environment by
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create an environment called `rmlp`, activate it with
```
conda activate rmlp
```
Use
```
python demo.py
```
to run the demo script.
